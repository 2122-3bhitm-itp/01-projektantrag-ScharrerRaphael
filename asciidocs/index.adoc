== Project proposal

=== What is my idea and why am I going to do it?

My project is going to be the well known game Tetris, because I do not
have any experience in such projekts and I think that project will
offer a chance to get a better view of technologies which I have to use.

=== Required software/runtime environment:

In IntelliJ I will code with the programming language Java.
I would also use more technologies if I dependent on any but I
do not know what I will need like I said.
